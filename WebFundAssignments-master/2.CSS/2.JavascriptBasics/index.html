                            <p><span class="firstword">JavaScript</span> a cross-platform,object-oriented scripting language.JavaScript
                                is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language
                                allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.
                                JavaScript lives inside a hostenvironment(a web browser or node server), it can be connected 
                                to the objects of these environment to provide programatic control over them
                            </p>
                        <ul>

                                    <span class="firstword">Variable Declaration:</span> variables are containers for storing data values-imagine a cup 
                                you fill with coffee,the cup holds the coffee,a variable holds a value. All javascript variables 
                                must be identified with unique names. The unique nam,es are called identifiers.<mark>var X;</mark>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                    <span class="firstword">Variable Assignment:</span>Assignments operator assign values to the Javascript variables-our cup can have now coffee 
                                poured into it,giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operatorassigns a value to the variable.<mark>var X=10;</mark>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="firstword">Datatypes:</span>Datatypes are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need toknow the data type.
                                there are 6 data types that are Javascript primitives: Boolean-<mark>true</mark> or <mark>false</mark>;<mark>null</mark> -null aka nothing; number-<mark>42</mark> or <mark>3.14159</mark>
                                string-<mark>"Coding Dojo Rocks"</mark>;array-<mark>[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'] </mark>and object-<mark>{first_name:"Jane", Last_name:"Doe"}</mark>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                    <span class="firstword">Conditionals</span> when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions-hitting 
                                differnt code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. you can use conditional statements
                                in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements:<mark>if</mark>a specified condition is true,
                                do this code in our code block; <mark>else if</mark> to specify a condition to test,if the first condition is false;<mark>else</mark>we 
                                execute this block of code;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                    <span class="firstword">Loops</span> There are many different kind of loops in every programming laguage,but they all essentially
                                do thesame thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile,
                                well you run around the track four times and then you stop. thats loop!
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                    <span class="firstword">Function</span>Function Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. when we call our function this will run
                                that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk
                                from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first wescrew the legs to the table top;
                                next we place the table the right way up. Done!we finished our instructions. sadly there are a ton more tables 
                                to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
